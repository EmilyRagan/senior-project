## Research Notes
According to the [EPA's Carbon Footprint Calculator](https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/), regarding emissions from trash: "692 pounds of CO2 equivalent per year is about average for a household of 1 person. Your waste-related emissions are calculated based on the number of people in your household." If you select all of the recycling items (aluminum & steel cans, plastic, glass, newspaper, and magazines), then the total waste emissions goes down to 401lbs.

According to the [EPA's Carbon Footprint Calculator](https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/), regarding emissions from vehicles: "11,141 pounds of CO2 emissions is about average for one vehicle over a year."

According to the [EPA's Carbon Footprint Calculator](https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/), regarding emissions from energy usage:
 * Natural gas: "3,071 pounds of CO2 is about average for a household of one person over a year."
 * Electricity: "5,384 pounds of CO2 is about average for a household of one person over a year."
 * Fuel oil: "4,848 pounds of CO2 is about average for a household of one person over a year."
 * Propane: "2,243 pounds of CO2 is about average for a household of one person over a year."

[Meat consumption](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/meat-consumption-in-america.html)
 * On average, each American ate 48.8 kg of chicken in 2017
 * In 2017, Americans consumed an average of 25.8 kg of beef
 * An American consumes an average of 23.6 kg of pork annually. Pork is most commonly consumed in the form of bacon

[Beyond meat carbon footprint](https://consumerecology.com/beyond-meat-burger-carbon-footprint-environmental-impact/)
 * 0.68kg CO2 per 4oz beyond meat -> 2.72 kg per pound -> convert pounds to kilograms -> ~6kg CO2 per kg beyond meat
